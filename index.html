                I was introduced to the internet just past the decline of the dial-in bulletin board days when the county library started offering 26k dial up for a maximum of 2 hours a day per user. Within a couple of years, we had subscribed to a paid 56k service and I was firmly established in my place as a first generation netizen.

                    When you live somewhere long enough, you want to establish a residence. With no mentors or like-minded people to steer me in a better direction, I decided Microsoft's WYSi(kind of)WYG web editor would be a great starting point on learning to make websites. I spent the months leading up to the Y2K apocalypse making websites with an excessive number of iFrames.
