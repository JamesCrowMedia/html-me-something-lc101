                    I was introduced to the internet just past the decline of the dial-in bulletin board days when the county library started offering 26k dial up for a maximum of 2 hours a day per user. Within a couple of years, we had subscribed to a paid 56k service and I was firmly established in my place as a first generation netizen.

                    When you live somewhere long enough, you want to establish a residence. With no mentors or like-minded people to steer me in a better direction, I decided Microsoft's WYSi(kind of)WYG web editor would be a great starting point on learning to make websites. I spent the months leading up to the Y2K apocalypse making websites with an excessive number of iFrames.

                    You weren't a real website in the early 2000s if you didn't have a bad-ass flash splash page! I wanted to make the baddest of ass websites, so I <em>borrowed</em> a copy of Flash from the internet- it only took about 3 days to download with a download manager! I never realized animation took... code? I learned how to copy and paste things until it kind of works.

                    The thing about being the only person in a town of less than 1500 people that really lives most of their life online... its a bit lonely. The rise of vbulletin style message boards did a pretty good job helping with that. On a few occasions, I managed to find myself as an admin with full access to all the wonderful gibberish that makes the whole thing run. When the people want new features, you give them new features. Sometimes you have to restore from backup when you copy and pasted the worst thing possible.

                    When I first opened Frontpage, the biggest frustration I had was “what do you mean I have to edit every page if I want to change one common element. Hence: soooooo many iFrames. Wordpress fixed this at the expense of making every other thing much, much more complex. I did eventually get quite good at throwing together quick websites by modifying themes and adding modules.

                    I was getting paid to make things like videos <em>(yay)</em>! I was also getting paid to make flash ads <em>(boo)</em>! For the uninitiated, Flash is the worst piece of software ever. You can copy and paste the exact same code 5 times and somehow it will fail 50% of the time. Describing it with a math error is the only appropriate way to get across just how bad it is.

                    When Google announced Chrome would no longer allow Flash ads to auto-run I was pretty happy. Flash was finally on the way out. As you would expect, ad-serving company I worked with on behalf of my client decided to prepare by doing absolutely noting until two weeks before the deadline, and then when into full blown panic mode. I was able to use the bits and pieces of knowledge gained over my past experiences to help them troubleshoot a workable solution.

                    In the last few months I have made a lot of progress. I have a pretty good grasp on Python, I am pretty comfy with Javascript, and if I can ever remember all the new HTML5 elements I will be solid there. I have successfully completed a small project with a Raspberry Pi and am starting one with an Arduino. The biggest obstacle for me getting here was the lack of a community. Since moving to St. Louis in September, I've found that in Launchcode and Arch Reactor.
